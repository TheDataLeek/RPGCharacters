    "    * Can effectively ‘hack’, protect data and prevent access to devices.  Owned and/or regularly used devices are protected; only those with an equal/greater number of points in this skill and a successful knowledge (Computers) roll can access protected devices.  Conversely, you can do the same.\n",
    "    * Have intuitive knowledge of computer/security architecture - what leads to what. Can devise simple programs to handle tasks.  Programs follow simple instructions and can attack, defend, infiltrate, gather information/research, or fill another role (ie. a game amuses).  Creating a program is a craft check, requiring Wits for the speed of completion and Knowledge for the quality of the construction.\n",

In daily activity, have a number of flash drives or pre-made programs on hand equal to number of knowledge pips; each such device allows near-instant progress past a barrier or near-instant task completion, unless the target is more skilled (more knowledgeable if skill is equal); if they are, then this serves to cut the time to finish the job to $50$%.\n",
